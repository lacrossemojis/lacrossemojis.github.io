LacrossEmojis (The Gnar Company, Inc) Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us and we take it very seriously. We want to build
a trusting relationship with our users. To better protect your privacy we
provide this notice explaining our online and software information practices and
in which way your information is collected and used.
Collect of Information
We want to be very clear in stating that we do not collect, read or do anything
with your private information. In order to use LacrossEmojis as a 3rd party
keyboard, you need to authorize “full access”. Under no circumstances do we
read, view or collect your conversations, text messages or anything typed on
your keyboard (credit card info, addresses and other sensitive information).
Apple requires us to “allow full access” to the keyboard in order for us to be
able to provide you with acess to our icons, through the keyboard extension. 
The only thing we track is how many times the LacrossEmojis app is opened and
which stickers you downloaded or purchased. This is all done anonymously to
ensure users privacy. 
Use of Information
We may use your information to:
• Provide, maintain and improve our services, including to provide additional
features
• Respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide customer service
• Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and
administrative messages
• Communicate with you about products, services, offers, and rewards, and events
offered by LacrossEmojis and provide news and information we think will be of
interest to you
• Detect, investigate and/or prevent fraudulent, unauthorized or illegal
activity
• You may opt out permanently from notifications at anytime
Analytics companies may access anonymous data (such as your IP address or unique
ID) to help us understand how our services are used. They use this data solely
on our behalf. They do not share it except in aggregate form; no data is shared
as to any individual user.
